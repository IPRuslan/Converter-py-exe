# Python to EXE Converter

## Description.
This program allows you to convert Python scripts to executable files (.exe)
After converting the `.exe' file, it can run without Python,
but **Python and PyInstaller** must be installed to perform the conversion process.

## Installation

To use this converter you need to have installed:
- Python (version 3.9.2 or later if it will work :) )
- PyInstaller (Python library required)

### Steps:
1. Install Python from the official website [python.org] (https://www.python.org).
2. Install PyInstaller with `pip`:

   pip install pyinstaller
3.Run the program to create

Important:
Python is required to create the .exe file (to run PyInstaller).
The .exe file itself, created after conversion,
does not require Python and can run on computers where Python is not installed.

Example of use:
1. select the .py file you want to convert to an .exe file 
2. select the icon in the .ico extension (if you refuse, it will be standard)
3. wait 

IMPORTANT: The program may “pretend to hang”
 it will not respond, although in fact only the interface does not respond
 and other processes do their work
